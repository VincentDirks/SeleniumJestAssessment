## Task

Identify at least one test scenario from the website https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/ and automate it. Please use Selenium (No framework is necessary if you don't have one, you can use just raw Selenium. Please keep your code simple and concise.

## Prerequisites

On my Win 11 (Home) laptop

- VS Code installed
- GitHub account created
- New (this) repo created
- Repo cloned in VS Code

## Steps Performed

I performed the following steps, generally updating this README.md, and submitting commits for each step or so. The terminal commands were executed using GitBash. No Git branching strategy was used (as yet), just committing straight to main for now.

1. Updated Node.js to LTS v20.9.0 from https://nodejs.org/en
1. Initialised a new node project `npm init -y`
1. Setup Jest `npm install --save-dev jest`
1. Create sum function, and a Jest test for it. (Using ES6 module syntax)
